### Hi there, I'm Fredrik 👋

I'm a web developer with over 22 years of experience. 
I used to do .NET but these days it's all about frontend, React and Next.js 😁

Occationaly I write blog posts at my personal homepage: (www.bergqvist.it)[https://www.bergqvist.it] and if you want to reach me I'm on twitter as (@f_bergqvist)[https://twitter.com/f_bergqvist]
